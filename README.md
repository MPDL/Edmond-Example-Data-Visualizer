# Edmond-Example-Data-Visualizer

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook that provides an illustrative example of a research data visualization methodology that can facilitate understanding of complex information. The research data were drawn from the Edmond Research Data Repository from the publication Majorities for Minorities: Participatory Constitution Making and the Protection of Minority Rights (Hudson & Alexander, 2020). As an example, key variables from the paper, such as the minority rights index and population participation for different countries, were plotted on a map for better understanding. Charts were also created to illustrate the hypotheses proposed in the study.
